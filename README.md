# Kotlin Reactive Stock Service [![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

This project is a Kotlin REST & RSocket service which streams a randomly generated set of prices. 

This project is based on the demo at [SpringOne Platform 2019](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/), which was an update of an application demonstrated by Josh Long and Trisha Gee at Code One 2018. The original Kotlin service was built by [Josh](https://github.com/joshlong).

This specific code is an [IntelliJ IDEA tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/) showing how to build Reactive applications with Kotlin, Spring, Java and JavaFX. This project works on Java 8.
